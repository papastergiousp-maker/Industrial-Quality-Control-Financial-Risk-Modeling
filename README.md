This project simulates the decision-making logic of a Quality Control Analyst in the food industry (inspired by my experience at D. Nomikos). It demonstrates how Python can transform daily pH measurements into actionable financial insights and risk assessments.
This project uses 100% synthetic data and personal cost estimations for methodology demonstration purposes only; it does not contain real or confidential corporate data.Project LogicThe analysis processes 480 samples (simulating a 60-day production season) using a Python-based engine to categorize batches and calculate financial impact:Optimal (pH ≤ 4.30): High quality, €0 cost.Correction (pH 4.31 - 4.50): Requires citric acid, €500 operational cost.Critical Waste (pH > 4.50): Batch discarded, €5,000 loss.Technical FeaturesData Simulation: Generated a Normal Distribution of pH values using NumPy ($\mu=4.22$) to reflect a realistic production environment.
Logical Engine: Built with a robust If-Elif-Else structure to handle batch categorization.Analytics: Used Pandas for data aggregation and Seaborn for visual reporting.
Financial Impact: Calculates the total loss percentage, translating technical metrics into business value.
Tools Used Python 3 Pandas , NumPy, Matplotlib & Seaborn
